## The Era of Embodied Intelligence

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This textbook serves as the comprehensive guide for the **Panaversity Physical AI Capstone**, where we bridge the gap between the digital brain (LLMs) and the physical body (Humanoid Robots).

In this course, you will learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using the industry-standard stack: **ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac**.

## Textbook Structure

This book is organized into 5 core modules, mirroring the "nervous system" of a robot:

* **[Chapter 1: The Nervous System](/docs/chapter1)** - Foundations of ROS 2 and middleware.
* **[Chapter 2: The Digital Twin](/docs/chapter2)** - Physics simulation in Gazebo.
* **[Chapter 3: The AI Brain](/docs/chapter3)** - Photorealistic training in NVIDIA Isaac Sim.
* **[Chapter 4: Vision-Language-Action](/docs/chapter4)** - Integrating OpenAI Whisper and VLA models.
* **[Chapter 5: Capstone](/docs/chapter5)** - The final Autonomous Humanoid project.

## Hardware Requirements

To follow this course effectively, you need access to the "Digital Twin" workstation:
* **GPU:** NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti (12GB VRAM) or higher.
* **OS:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
* **RAM:** 64 GB DDR5.
