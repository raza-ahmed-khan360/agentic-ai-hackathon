## Strict Adherence Verification

### Must-Follow Items

#### Constitution Compliance
- ✅ Backend enforces: API standards, Vector DB, Gemini, .env, tests, docs
- ✅ Memory enforces: Single source of truth, specs-first, decisions, PHRs, hierarchy, accessibility
- ✅ My-AI-Book enforces: Clarity, Docusaurus, minimal jargon, quality, portability, AI-Native focus

#### Specification Requirements
- ✅ All projects enforce spec-first development
- ✅ All projects have spec, plan, checklist templates
- ✅ All projects organize features in `specs/` with IDs

#### Traceability Requirements
- ✅ All projects have structured PHR folders
- ✅ All projects have PHR templates
- ✅ All projects support feature-specific tracking

#### Development Guidelines
- ✅ All projects document guidelines in GEMINI.md
- ✅ All projects reference constitution in GEMINI.md
- ✅ All projects establish agent behavior rules

### Must-Not Items
- ✅ No specifications skipped (template enforces)
- ✅ No untracked work (PHR structure mandates tracking)
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets (GEMINI.md forbids it)
- ✅ No constitution violations (each project states rules)
