# Project Memory and Knowledge Base Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Single Source of Truth
All project specifications, decisions, and architectural records must be stored in the memory/ and specs/ directories for centralized access.

### II. Specification-First Development
All work must begin with clear specifications defining scope, requirements, and success criteria.

### III. Decision Tracking
All significant architectural and technical decisions must be documented in Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) under specs/.

### IV. Prompt History Recording
All user interactions, feature work, and development decisions must be captured in Prompt History Records (PHRs) under history/prompts/.

### V. Knowledge Organization
Knowledge must be organized hierarchically: constitution → specs → plans → tasks → implementations.

### VI. Accessibility and Clarity
All documentation must be clear, well-structured, and free of unnecessary technical jargon to ensure accessibility.

## Governance
